# Welcome. This portfolio showcases my capstone project for CS-499 and my education journey at Southern New Hampshire University.

## Professional Self-Assesment

#### During my time in the computer science program at SNHU, I have had the oppurtunity to develop my professional skills and abilities. I started the program with minimal experience with computer science and developing code. As my time in the program passed, I quickly realized I made a great choice in this field of study as the deeper I went into the program, the more I wanted to learn. 

#### There are certain vital skills I have learned such as collaborating in a team environment, communicating with stakeholders, data structures and algorithms, software engineering and databases, and security. Each course I have taken refined one, or multiple skills in unique ways, leading up to my final capstone project presented in this portfolio.

## Skills learned from courses
 - [Writing test code](https://github.com/BRCooperrider/CS-320)
 - [OpenGL basics](https://github.com/BRCooperrider/CS-330)
 - [CRUD](https://github.com/BRCooperrider/CS-340)
 - [Embedded programming](https://github.com/BRCooperrider/CS-350)
 - [Mobile development](https://github.com/BRCooperrider/CS-360)
 - [Machine learning](https://github.com/BRCooperrider/CS-370)
 - [Secure coding principles](https://github.com/BRCooperrider/CS-405)

## Evaluation of Capstone
- Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science
- Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts
- Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices
- Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals
- Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources

## Mobile inventory application

#### For this capstone, I had to choose one or more artifacts that demonstrate my skills in three key categories:
- Software design and engineering
- Algorithms and data structure
- Databases

#### While I debated improving different artifacts for each category, I decided on improving a single artifact; a mobile inventory app I made during my time in CS-360: Mobile Architecture and Programming. This project was big enough where I could demonstrate my skills in the three categories through a single project.

## Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering

#### Link to [Enhancement One](https://github.com/BRCooperrider/BRCooperrider.github.io/tree/main/Inventory_App_Iterations/Original/Project_2_Bryce_Cooperrider_Inventory_App)
#### Link to [Enhancement One Writeup](https://github.com/BRCooperrider/BRCooperrider.github.io/blob/main/Writeups/Enhancement%20One%20Bryce%20Cooperrider.pdf)

#### To start with enhancement one, I wanted to clean up the layout of the main inventory screen. I removed a row from the top and bottom of the recycler view to allow room for the floating action button at the bottom and filtering/sorting capabilities at the top. I also added a popup to each item in the inventory to view additional details about an item. Within this popup view is an additional way to remove an item from the database; just click the delete item button and it is removed. The completion of this enhancement means I can check off two of the capstone evaluation criteria.
