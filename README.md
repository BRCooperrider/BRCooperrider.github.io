# Welcome. This portfolio showcases my capstone project for CS-499 at Southern New Hampshire University.

## Professional Self-Assesment

### During my time in the computer science program at SNHU, I have had the oppurtunity to develop my professional skills and abilities. I started the program with minimal experience with computer science and developing code. As my time in the program passed, I quickly realized I made a great choice in this field of study as the deeper I went into the program, the more I wanted to learn. 

### There are certain vital skills I have learned such as collaborating in a team environment, communicating with stakeholders, data structures and algorithms, software engineering and databases, and security. Each course I have taken refined one, or multiple skills in unique ways, leading up to my fianl capstone project presented in this portfolio.

## Skills learned from courses
 - [Writing test code](https://github.com/BRCooperrider/CS-320)
