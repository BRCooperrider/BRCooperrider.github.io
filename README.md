# Welcome. This portfolio showcases my capstone project for CS-499 at Southern New Hampshire University.

## Professional Self-Assesment

### During my time in the computer science program at SNHU, I have had the oppurtunity to develop my professional skills and abilities. I started the program with minimal experience with computer science and developing code. As my time in the program passed, I quickly realized I made a great choice in this field of study as the deeper I went into the program, the more I wanted to learn. 

This includes [writing test code](https://github.com/BRCooperrider/CS-320), learning [CRUD](https://github.com/BRCooperrider/CS-340), developing [embedded programs](https://github.com/BRCooperrider/CS-350), to [machine learning](https://github.com/BRCooperrider/CS-370).
